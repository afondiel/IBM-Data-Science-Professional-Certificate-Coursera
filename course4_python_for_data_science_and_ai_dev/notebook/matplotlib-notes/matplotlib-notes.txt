========= Matplotlib Notes =======

# Introduction to Matplotlib
- Most popular data viz library 
- Created by John Hunter(Neurobiologist)
- Initially created for EEG/ECoG Visualization Tool 
- Inspired from MATLAB 

## Matplotlib Architecture 
+--------------------------+
| Scripting Layer(pyplot)  |
+--------------------------+
+--------------------------+
| Artist Layer(artist)     |
+--------------------------+
+--------------------------+
| Backend Layer(FigCanvas..|
+--------------------------+

### Backend Layer(FigCanvas, renderer, events ...)
1. FigureCanvas : matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvas 
	=> Encompasses the area onto which the figure is drawn
2. Renderer :  matplotlib.backend_bases.Renderer
	=> Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas
3. Event : matplotlib.backend_bases.Event 
	=> Handles user inputs such as keyboards strokes and mouse clicks

### Artist Layer(artist)
- Comprised of one main object - *Artist*
	=> Know how to use the Renderer to draw on the Canvas
- Responsible for : Title, lines, tock labals, and images, all correspond to individuals Artist instances 
- 2 types of artist objects : 
	=> 1. Primitive : Line2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text 
	=> 2. Composite : Axis, Tick, Axes, and Figure
- Each composite artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists

### Scripting Layer
- Comprised mainly of pyplot, a scripting interface that is lighter that the Artist layer 
- Let's see how we can generate the same histogram of 10000 random values using the pyplot interface

# Basic Plotting with Matplotlib
- Support by differents env : Python scripts, iPython shell, web app & servers ... jupyter nb
- "Dynamic" ploting using BACKENDS : modify plot, costomize ...
- use magic functions(%) to execute backend objects 
	=> magic function starts w/ % sign
- Some backends : 
	=>%matplotlib inline : plot window within the browser and not in separeted window
	=>%matplotlib notebook : allows to modify figure once is RENDERED !
- Matplotlib - PANDAS 
	=> df.plot(kind="line")
	=> df["x"].plot(kind="hist")

# Dataset on Immigration to Canada
- Dataset : 
	=> src : United Nations (45 countries)
	=> annual data on the flows of international migrants
	=> migrants to canada dataset 

- Import the dataset with pandas
- to check the imported data : df.head, df.describe ...

# Line Plots
- continuos dataset  
- plot which displys information as series of data points called "markers" connected by the straight line segments
- using pandas dataframe, map function to create an iterative point per axis value
