## W1: Introduction to Data Visualization

# Syllabus
# Welcome
# Introduction to Data Visualization (Module 1)
## Main reason why data viz is important :  
	=> For exploratory data analysis
	=> Communicate data clearly
	=> Share unbiased representation of data
	=> Use them to support recommendation to different stakeholders
## Best practices : 
- Darkhorse Analytics : created in 2008 in (university of alberta)
- quantitative data consulting
- data viz & geo spatial analysis 
- data viz approach : a plot is meant to get accross NOT distractive
	1. Less is more effective
	2. Less is more attractive
	3. Less is more impactive 
- Goal : have a graphic easier to read, cleaner, less distractive, better to understand ..

# Introduction to Matplotlib
- Most popular data viz library 
- Created by John Hunter(Neurobiologist)
- Initially created for EEG/ECoG Visualization Tool 
- Inspired from MATLAB 

## Matplotlib Architecture 

```
+--------------------------+
| Scripting Layer(pyplot)  |
+--------------------------+
+--------------------------+
| Artist Layer(artist)     |
+--------------------------+
+--------------------------+
| Backend Layer(FigCanvas..|
+--------------------------+
```

### Backend Layer(FigCanvas, renderer, events ...)
1. FigureCanvas : matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvas 
	=> Encompasses the area onto which the figure is drawn
2. Renderer :  matplotlib.backend_bases.Renderer
	=> Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas
3. Event : matplotlib.backend_bases.Event 
	=> Handles user inputs such as keyboards strokes and mouse clicks

### Artist Layer(artist)
- Comprised of one main object - *Artist*
	=> Know how to use the Renderer to draw on the Canvas
- Responsible for : Title, lines, tock labals, and images, all correspond to individuals Artist instances 
- 2 types of artist objects : 
	=> 1. Primitive : Line2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text 
	=> 2. Composite : Axis, Tick, Axes, and Figure
- Each composite artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists

### Scripting Layer
- Comprised mainly of pyplot, a scripting interface that is lighter that the Artist layer 
- Let's see how we can generate the same histogram of 10000 random values using the pyplot interface

# Basic Plotting with Matplotlib
- Support by differents env : Python scripts, iPython shell, web app & servers ... jupyter nb
- "Dynamic" ploting using BACKENDS : modify plot, costomize ...
- use magic functions(%) to execute backend objects 
	=> magic function starts w/ % sign
- Some backends : 
	=>%matplotlib inline : plot window within the browser and not in separeted window
	=>%matplotlib notebook : allows to modify figure once is RENDERED !
- Matplotlib - PANDAS 
	=> df.plot(kind="line")
	=> df["x"].plot(kind="hist")

# Dataset on Immigration to Canada
- Dataset : 
	=> src : United Nations (45 countries)
	=> annual data on the flows of international migrants
	=> migrants to canada dataset 

- Import the dataset with pandas
- to check the imported data : df.head, df.describe ...

# Line Plots
- continuos dataset  
- plot which displys information as series of data points called "markers" connected by the straight line segments
- using pandas dataframe, map function to create an iterative point per axis value 

# Lab
# Quiz

## W2: Basic & Specialized Visualization Tools

# Area Plots
- Also known as 'area chart / graph'
- commonly used to represent cumulated totals using numbers or percentages over time
- based on the 'line plot'
- Dataset-processing steps : 
=> index : country (since we want to know/focus on canada)
	=> now each represents a country
=> add a 'total() column (number of total(sum of population/immigrants) per country)
	=> sorting by descending or order allows to get highest population per country
=> df_canada (Dataframes Canada specified )
=> Fix index problems : transposition axis, sort_values ...
- generate "area plot"  : plot(kind='area')

# Histograms
- way of representing the frequency distribution of a variable 
- To generate "histogram"  : plot(kind='hist')
- To correct horizontal axis problem : split the bins(ticks) with numpy (np.histogram())
	=> then use theses bins(values) to generate the histogram w/ matplotlib 

# Bar Charts
- Unlike a histogram, a bar chart is commonly used to compare the values of a variable at given point in time.
- generate "bar plot"  : plot(kind='bar')

# Lab
# Quiz

# Pie Charts
- graphs divided into slices to illustrated numerical proportion
- generate "pie plot"  : df.plot(kind='pie')
- Cons : fail to represent data in a consistent way and getting the data accros(presentable, understandble, clear, visible ...)  

# Box Plots
- Way of statistically representing the distribution of given data 
through 5 main dimensions : 
	1. min == (IQR - IQR*1.5) (Inter Quartile Range)
	2. 25% (1st IQR)
	3 50% = median
	4. 75% (3/4 of sorted data)
	5. max (75% + IQR*1.5)
- display outliers as individuals dots that occur outside the upper and lower extremes
- generate "pie plot"  : df.plot(kind='box')

# Scatter Plots (nuage des points)
- displays relationship datas btw 2 variables (x, y) to determine if any correlation exists
- generate "scatter plot"  : df.plot(kind='scatter', x='df_x', y='df_y')  

# Lab
# Quiz

## W3: Advanced Visualization & Geospatial data

# Waffle Charts
- interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals
- the more the contribution the more tiles(visibility) 
- matplotlib doesn't have a built-in function to generate waffle charts 

# Word Clouds
- A depiction of the frequency of different words in some textual data 
- the more specific the word appears in the source of textual data the bigger/bolder in word cloud 
- Matplotlib doesn't have a function/module to generate word clouds but Python does! 
- Andreas Mueller (created a python lib for cloud word generation)
- usage => Lab session

# Seaborn and Regression Plots
- Python visualization library based on matplotlib
- provides high level interface for drawing attractive statisticals graphics : regression plots, box plots ...
- less lines of codes to plot than matplotlib

# Lab
# Quiz

# Introduction to Folium
- Powerful Python library that helps you create several types of Leaflet maps 
- First created to visualize Geospatial data 
- locate any word based on : [latitude, longitude] values 
- It enables both the binding of data to map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing visualizations as markers on the map
- The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox API keys. 
## Creating a World Map
- word_map = folium.Map()
- It's possible to get a specific map place/location(latitude/longitude)
- Also possible to add different styles of maps ...

# Maps with Markers
- create a feature group
	=> add children (w/ the location of the place you want to show)
	=> add markers 
	=> markers can be labeled 

# Choropleth Maps
- Thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned i proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map : 
	=>  poplulation density or per capita income ...
	=> The higher the *measurement* the darker the color 
- this graph required : Geojson to be setup (json file with some metadatas)
## Creating the Map : 
- world_map.choropleth() + world_geo_json_path

## W4: Creating a Dashborad with Plotly and Dash

# Module Overview and Learning Objectives
# Dashboarding Overview
- Interactive Data Application (IDA) can help improve business performance
## Dashborad : 
=> Realtime visuals
=> Understand business moving parts
=> Visual track, analyze, and display key performance indicators(KPI)
=> Take informed decisions and improve performance 
=> Reduced hours of analyzing
- Best dashboards answer important business questions
## (Practical) Scenario
- Monitor and report US airline performance 
=> Requested report items 
1. Top 10 airline carrier in year 2019 in terms of number of flights 
2. Number of flights in 2019 split by month 
3. Nb of travelers from California (CA) to other states split by distance group
- Presenting results in Table and Documents is time consumming, less visual, and difficult to understand ...
- A datascientist should be able to create and deliver a story around the *finding* in a way a stakeholders can easily understand 
	=> Datashboards are the way to go !!! 
## Tools : Web-based Dashboarding
- Dash from Plotly 
	=> Python framework for web analytic applications
	=> written in the top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js 
	=> data viz apps with highly custom UI 
- Panel 
	=> works with visualizations from Brokeh, Matplotlib, HoloViews ... 
- Voil√† : turns jupyter nb into standalone web app 
	=> jupyter-flex 
	=> template : voila-vuetify
- Streamlit : datascripts into shareable web apps w/ 3 rules 
	=> embrace python scripting 
	=> treat widgets variables
	=> reuse data and computation

## Tools : Dashboarding
- Bokeh
- ipywidgets 
- matplotlib
- Bowtie
- Flask (dashboard)
