# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Coursera

## Overview

I [recently completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/GRC4DCMSV5PH?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=pdf_header_button&utm_product=prof) the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from Coursera, and here are my [notes](#) and what I learnt.

## Motivation 

I took this course after reading the brilliant and famous article [Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). As a software engineer working in the automotive industry, I'm always wondering to myself: `What will the future of the automotive industry look like a decade or half-century from now?`

The only thing that comes to mind is that the future will be something like self-driving cars or automated cars equipped with very advanced AI systems. As more features and functionalities emerge, the number of sensors and ECUs will also increase, and there will be a lot of data to deal with.

That's why I took this course, to become familiar with the laws of data science and understand how they can be applied in the automotive industry to make vehicles **smarter** and **safer**.

The full specialization is based on 10 courses, but you can take each of them separately if you're mostly interested in one particular topic.

## What you will learn?

```
1. What is Data Science?
2. Tools for Data Science
3. Data Science Methodology
4. Python for Data Science, AI & Development
5. Python Project for Data Science
6. Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
7. Data Analysis with Python
8. Data Visualization with Python
9. Machine Learning with Python
10. Applied Data Science Capstone
```

Happy learning ! :blush:
