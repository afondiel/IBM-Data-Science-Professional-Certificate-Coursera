I recently [completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/GRC4DCMSV5PH?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=pdf_header_button&utm_product=prof) the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from Coursera, and here are my notes, course resources and project assignments.

## Motivation 

I took this course after reading this great article: ["Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) from Harvard Business Review. 

As a Software Engineer in the automotive sector, I wonder: What will the automotive industry resemble in the coming decades or even half a century (from 2022)?

I see a future dominated by self-driving or highly automated cars with advanced AI systems. With evolving features, sensor and ECU numbers will increase, substantial data will be generated and every solution will be `data-based`.

That's why I took this course, to become familiar with the laws of data science and understand how they can be applied in the automotive industry to make vehicles **smarter** and **safer**.

## What You Will Learn?

The full specialization consists of 10 courses, but each can be taken individually for those focused on specific topics.

1. [What is Data Science?](./course1_what_s_data_science/)
2. [Tools for Data Science](./course2_tools_for_data_science/)
3. [Data Science Methodology](./course3_data_science_methodology/)
4. [Python for Data Science, AI & Development](./course4_python_for_data_science_and_ai_dev/)
5. [Python Project for Data Science](./course6_databases_sql_for_data_science_w_python/)
6. [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](./course7_data_analysis_w_python/)
7. [Data Analysis with Python](./course7_data_analysis_w_python/)
8. [Data Visualization with Python](./course8_data_viz_w_python/)
9. [Machine Learning with Python](./course9_machine_learning_w_python/)
10. [Applied Data Science Capstone](./couse10_applied_data_science_capstone/)

Happy learning!
