# IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Coursera - Notes

## Overview

I [recently completed](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/GRC4DCMSV5PH?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=pdf_header_button&utm_product=prof) the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) from Coursera and here are my [notes](#) and what I learnt.

## Motivation 

I took this course after reading this brilliant and  famous article  :point_right: [Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). As Software Engineer working in the Automotive industry, I'm always wondering my-self :  `what the future of automotive industry will look a decade or half-century from now ?` 

And the only thing that comes to my mind is : `the future will be something like self-driving Cars or Automated Cars equiped with very advanced AI systems`. 

So more features and functionalities will emerge, therefore the numbers of sensors and ECU will also increase, and then there will be alot of `datas` to deal with.

That's why I took this course, to become familiar with Data Science `Laws` and understand how they can be applied in the automotive industry in order to make vehicules become **smarter** and **safer**.


The full specialization is based on 10 courses, but you can take each of them separately if you're mostly interested in one particular topic.

## What you will learn
- ### COURSE 1. What is Data Science?
- ### COURSE 2. Tools for Data Science
- ### COURSE 3. Data Science Methodology
- ### COURSE 4. Python for Data Science, AI & Development
- ### COURSE 5. Python Project for Data Science
- ### COURSE 6.  Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
- ### COURSE 7. Data Analysis with Python
- ### COURSE 8. Data Visualization with Python
- ### COURSE 9. Machine Learning with Python
- ### COURSE 10.  Applied Data Science Capstone

Happy learning ! :blush:
