### What is Data Science ? 

`Data Science is a process to understand data and do differents things`
- keywords : trends, insights, data structured and unstructured, expore, manipulation, find answers, recommendation

### Fundamentals of Data Scientist : 
- Data Analysis (question problem ? => Find Answers => Create Value)
- Data Science (Deal with different type of datas) : log files, social medias, email, sales data, patient info files, sports perfomance data, sensor data, security camera ...
- **Be curious**
- Data visualization => to explain => trends, to tell history, to detect a pattern, new behaiviour ...

### Many path to Data Science

- Maths : statistics
- Business Analysis & strategies
- SW Engineer
/!\ Soft skills/Qualities : Cusiosity, Take Position => Confidence, Story teller

### What do Data Scientists do ?
- recomendation algorithm
- Prediction Model
- Find patterns 
- unstructured vs strutured data

### A day in life of Data Scientist ?
- > /!\ Find solution by analyzing datas
- > Curious, fluency in analysis, good communication skills => story teller

### Old vs new problems ? 
- old => Predict congestion (uber taxi)
- new => Environment, Climate Changes

      - Find (new) solution  : 
      		=> Identify the problem  \
      		=> Gather datas     	  \ BUILD A MODEL !
      		=> Identify 			  /
      		=> Tools				 /

### Topics algorithms
- list : regression, data viz, neural net, nearest neighbour, classification ...
- strutured data : ranged / organized data (excel row, colomns) 
- unstructured data :  comes from sensors(video, audio...), web not in row /colomns


### Clouds for Data Scientist ?
- Cloud : Cloud allows to access to data, collaborate easy
  - Storage data, high performance computing, save physical space in own computer, simulations work in the same data
- IBM : IBM Cloud
- Amazon : Amazon Web Services(AWS)
- Google  : Google Cloud Platform
- Tools : Hadloop, stata ...

## W2 : Data Science Topics

###  Foundations of Big Data ?
#### Big Data and Data Mining 

- Two approches
1. Approach (traditional) : Statistical analysis
2. Approach : unsupervised + machine-learning algorithms.

- Goal: to explore hitherto unknown trends and insights by subjecting data to analysis

### What is Hadoop ?

Big Data(BD) : Dynamic, large, Disperate volume of data, created(apps, machine, tools ...)

- **The 5Vs** : 
  - `Velocity` : Speed data (quick RT)
  - `Volume`:	Scalable (2,5 quintillons bytes => 10 millions DVDS)
  - `Variety`: Diversity => data come from diffrent Sources (audio, video, img ...) 
  - `Veracity`: qlity / origin of data (Releablity, accuracy)
  - `Value` : turns data to value (Solution, profits..)

*Data scientist extract/drives data from big data*
 Tools : 
	- Apache sparks
	- Hadoop (created by Dong Cutting ) => based on Data Cluster, splits data into a pieces to computing a large amount of data (gain speed, performance ...)
 
### How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation?
  
    	CEO => working w/ CDO & CIO and the financial department to adapt the needs

				/ 					\
			CDO						CIO 
    	(Chief Data Officer)  (Chief Information Officer)

- Data Science Skills & Big Data 
  - Cloud
  - Programming Skills
  - Python (panda for data viz)
  - R
  - Unix/Lunix
  - Maths(Algebra Statistics)
  - Jupyter note book + AWS (Virtual Account)
  - BIG DATA (concept created by Google, Statistical technics to handle large volume of data)

  
#### Data Mining?

7 Steps Down the Data Mining : 

1. Establish data mining goals
 - set up goals for the exercise.
 - identify the key questions that need to be answered
 - costs and benefits of exercise
 - Define expected exercise resultats and accuracy
 - High levels of accuracy from data mining would cost more and vice versa.
 
2. **Select data**

 - The output of a data mining exercise largely depends upon the quality of data being used.
 - Data might be available 
 - If Data not available then go to  : plan new data collection initiatives, including surveys 
 - The type of data, its size, and frequency of collection have a direct bearing on the cost
 - Datas come from differents Databases
 
 
3. **Preprocess data**
 - clean
 - identify relevant attributes
 - identify the irrelevant attributes of data
 
4. **Transform data**
 - determine the appropriate format in which data must be stored
 - data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to explain the phenomena
  --- using Data reduction algorithms
 - store data in the variables
 
5. **Store data**
 - Storing Data into the right/good Data mining format for immediate read/write
 - new variables can be created to store data and temporary write/read back into the database
 - store data on servers or storage media that keeps the data secure
 - Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data.


6. **Mine data**
 - After data is appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, it is subject to data mining
 - data analysis methods
 - including parametric
 - non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
 /!\ - data visualization : good starting point for data mining
 - Multidimensional views of the data
 - data mining software
 - *FIND  : HIDDEN trends in the data*
 
7. **Evaluate data mining results**
 - Extract the result 
 - Do a formal evaluation 
 - > Testing the predictative capabilities of the model
 - > efficiency & of the algorithms in the producing data
 
 /!\ in-sample forecast
 
 -> Share the result w/ Stakeholders
 -> improve the quality of the resultat from the shared feedback
 
### Data Scientists at New York University 

### Deep Learning and Machine Learning ? 
---
- `ML` => Algorithms
- `DL` => Model based on Neural Network 
- `DS` => Extracting knowledge/insights of large volume of (disparated) data 
  - Maths Technics : statistical analysis, data viz, ML/DL algo/ Models
